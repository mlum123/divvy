# Divvy
### a better way to divvy up chores

Historically, women have been primarily responsible for childcare responsibilities and household chores, and this inequality has only been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. With children taking classes from home all the time, moms are having to dedicate more time to their kids than ever before, while juggling their own work responsibilities. They're hanging by a thin thread, and some are even dropping their careers to keep their households running.

and probably many, many more on the web...

Meet Divvy: a web application made with React and the Google Calendar API for Pearl Hacks 2021. Divvy uses OAuth2.0 authentication to allow users to sign in via their Google accounts, giving Divvy access to their Google Calendars. Then, Divvy can create and update a weekly household Google Calendar of tasks, which household members are responsible for them, and when they will be done. This calendar will be available when the user visits the regular Google Calendar site, or when the user signs into Divvy!

Divvy also displays the distribution of tasks among family members for the week in a visually appealing manner. If some people are doing more than their fair share, Divvy will alert users. This enables users to then re-delegate tasks so that they are distributed among household members more evenly. Thus, Divvy helps ensure that no one person in the household is shouldering too much of the burden, and that everyone is pitching in to help.

Women shouldn't be set back by the coronavirus pandemic. Let’s say no to the household gender gap!

## Technologies Used

React, Reactstrap for using Bootstrap components in React, JavaScript, CSS, the Google Calendar API, Node.js

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
